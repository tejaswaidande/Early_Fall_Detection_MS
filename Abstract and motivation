Falls are a major cause of injury and reduced quality of life in people with Multiple Sclerosis
(MS). Traditional clinical assessments often rely on isolated scores or subjective reporting, which
may overlook the complex interplay of factors that contribute to fall risk. This thesis presents a
scalable machine learning pipeline designed to predict fall risk in MS patients using real-world
clinical data.
The dataset consisted of 2,465 patients, of which only 47 were identified as fallers, creating
a highly imbalanced prediction problem. To address this, a stratified 70/15/15 split was applied
to preserve the ratio of fallers and non-fallers across training, validation, and test sets.
Logistic Regression was used as a transparent baseline, while Histogram Gradient Boosting
was employed to capture non-linear relationships and feature interactions. Model evaluation
emphasized clinical metrics specificity and sensitivity over simple accuracy, as accuracy alone
would be misleading under severe imbalance. Results showed that Logistic Regression achieved
an AUC of 0.648, with a clinically meaningful threshold of 0.71 yielding 90% specificity while
retaining sensitivity of 43%. Histogram Gradient Boosting further improved predictive power
while maintaining interpretability through feature importance measures.
The findings demonstrate that fall prediction in MS is feasible with structured, tabular data
and that carefully balancing specificity and sensitivity is essential for clinical trust. Beyond
predictive accuracy, the thesis highlights the importance of transparency, reproducibility, and
alignment with clinical priorities when applying machine learning in healthcare.
